This package makes it easy to one or more customizable tables of contents in Org files that can be updated manually, or automatically when the file is saved.  Links to headings are created compatible with GitHub's Org renderer.

** MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

** Manual

  Install these required packages:

+  =dash=
+  =s=

  Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'org-make-toc)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

1.  Make a heading in the Org file where you want the table of contents, and give it the Org property =TOC= with the value =this=.
2.  Run the command =org-make-toc=.

** Advanced

A document may contain multiple tables of contents.  Tables of contents can be customized by setting the =TOC= property of headings to these values:

+  =all=: Include all headings in the file, except ignored headings.
+  =children=: Include only child headings of this ToC.
+  =siblings=: Include only sibling headings of this ToC.
+  =ignore=: Omit a heading from the TOC.
+  =ignore-children= or =0=: Omit a heading's child headings from the TOC.
+  a number =N=: Include child headings up to =N= levels deep in the TOC.

** Automatically update on save

To automatically update a file's TOC when the file is saved, use the command =add-file-local-variable= to add =org-make-toc= to the Org file's =before-save-hook=.

Or, you may activate it in all Org buffers like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-make-toc-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Example

See [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc/blob/master/example.org][example.org]] for a comprehensive example of the features described above.

** 0.3

*Additions*
+  Option ~org-make-toc-filename-prefix~ to add the filename before the anchor in links.  This allows a ToC to refer to entries in another file by manually copying a ToC from one file into another.  See [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc/pull/2][issue 2]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/dakra][Daniel Kraus]].

*Changes*
+  Minor refactoring.

** 0.2

*Additions*
+  Multiple tables of contents are now supported in a single document.
+  Entries' =TOC= property can now also be set to the values =all=, =children=, and =siblings=, which allow tables of contents to be created for only parts of a document.
     -  =all= includes all entries in a document, including other tables of contents, except ignored entries.
     -  =children= includes only child entries, except ignored entries.
     -  =siblings= includes only sibling entries, except ignored entries.
+  The command =org-make-toc-mode= toggles =org-make-toc= on the =before-save-hook= in the current buffer.  This may be added to the global =org-mode-hook= to activate it in every Org buffer.
+  The =examples.org= file shows an example of all of the options used together in a complex, book-like document.

** 0.1

This package makes it easy to have a customizable table of contents in Org files that can be updated manually, or automatically when the file is saved.  Links to headings are created compatible with GitHub's Org renderer.

** MELPA

If you installed from MELPA, you're done.

** Manual

  Install these required packages:

+  =dash=
+  =s=

  Then put this file in your load-path, and put this in your init file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require 'org-make-toc)
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

1.  Make a heading in the Org file where you want the table of contents, and give it the Org property =TOC= with the value =this=.
2.  Run the command =org-make-toc=.

** Customization

The table of contents can be customized by setting the =TOC= property of headings:

+  Set to =ignore= to omit a heading from the TOC.
+  Set to =ignore-children= or =0= to omit a heading's child headings from the TOC.
+  Set to a number =N= to include child headings no more than =N= levels deep in the TOC.

** Automatically update on save

To automatically update a file's TOC when the file is saved, use the command =add-file-local-variable= to add =org-make-toc= to the Org file's =before-save-hook=.

** Example

See [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alphapapa/org-make-toc/master/README.org][this readme file]] for an example of the features described above.
